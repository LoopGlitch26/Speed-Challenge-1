We used this to calculate the gallons of water conserved in our facility online: [US cup to US gallon](http://convert-to.com/conversion/water-weight-volume/convert-us-gal-of-water-volume-to-us-cup-volume-of-water.html)

We tried to understand the US water crisis, thanks to this site: [the water project](https://thewaterproject.org/water-scarcity/water_scarcity_in_us)

We tried to know the feasibility of our project using this: [Tactical Project Management](https://www.tacticalprojectmanagement.com/five-steps-to-determine-project-feasibility/)

We got the idea of pipeline problems in North America using this site: [Safety Management](https://safetymanagement.eku.edu/blog/our-nations-growing-water-crisis-what-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20American%20Water,is%20a%20first%2Dworld%20country.)

We got the idea of future impact of water crisis on North America using this site: [Harvard.edu](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/widespread-water-shortage-likely-in-u-s-caused-by-population-growth-and-climate-change/)
